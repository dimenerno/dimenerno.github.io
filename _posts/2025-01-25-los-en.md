## 5. Nonstandard Characteristics of Hypernatural Numbers

Thus far, the hypernatural numbers we have examined have been those corresponding to standard natural numbers, such as $[0], [1], [2], \dots$. We shall now examine hypernatural numbers that diverge from the standard natural numbers.

Consider the following hypernatural number $\mathfrak{n}$:

$$
(1, 2, 3, 4, \dots) \in \mathfrak{n}
$$

Note that we express this as a membership relation rather than equality, as the definition of hypernatural numbers involves equivalence classes. Recalling the definition of inequality in hypernatural numbers, we observe that for any natural number $n$, we have $[n] < \mathfrak{n}$. That is, $\mathfrak{n}$ is a hypernatural number greater than all natural numbers. Therefore, the following holds in the hypernatural numbers:

$$
\phi_1 : \exists x \; ( \lbrace y : y < x \rbrace \text{ is infinite } )
$$

This proposition does not hold in the natural numbers.

Now consider the following hypernatural number $\mathfrak{m}$:

$$
(1, 2!, 3!, 4!, \dots) \in \mathfrak{m}
$$

For any standard natural number $n$, $\mathfrak{m}$ is divisible by $[n]$. That is, $\mathfrak{m}$ has every natural number as a divisor. Therefore, the following holds in the hypernatural numbers:

$$
\phi_2 : \exists x \; (\lbrace y : y \mid x \rbrace \text{ is infinite })
$$

This proposition also does not hold in the natural numbers.

However, there appears to be something peculiar here. In the introduction to the previous article, I stated that the natural numbers and hypernatural numbers are logically indistinguishable. Yet $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are true in $\mathbb{N}^*$ but false in $\mathbb{N}$, suggesting that they are logically distinguishable. Have I been misleading?

Not at all. The key to resolving this apparent paradox lies in the fact that $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are sentences that cannot be expressed in first-order logic. By the compactness theorem, "... is finite" cannot be expressed in first-order logic.

The precise meaning of the statement that $\mathbb{N}^*$ and $\mathbb{N}$ are logically indistinguishable is as follows:

> **Definition.** Two models $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_2$ of a language $\mathcal{L}$ are **elementarily equivalent** if for any (first-order logic) sentence $\phi$,
>
> $$
> \mathcal{M_1} \vDash \phi \iff \mathcal{M}_2 \vDash \phi
> $$

> **Theorem.** $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}^*$ are elementarily equivalent.

This theorem is a special case of Łoś's theorem. Before introducing Łoś's theorem, let us first examine the concept of generalised ultraproducts.

## 6. Ultraproducts

Let a set $I$ and a free ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $I$ be given. Furthermore, let models $\lbrace \mathcal{M}\_i \rbrace_{i \in I}$ of a language $\mathcal{L}$ be given. We define the **ultraproduct** $\mathcal{M}^* = \prod \mathcal{M}_i / \mathcal{U}$ as follows:

> #### Elements of the Ultraproduct
>
> The elements of $\mathcal{M}^*$ are equivalence classes of $\lbrace (a\_i)\_{i\in I} : a\_i \in \mathcal{M}\_i \rbrace$ under the relation $\sim$, where $\sim$ is defined as:

> (a_i)_{i\in I} \sim (b_i)_{i \in I} \iff \lbrace i \in I : a_i = b_i \rbrace \in \mathcal{U}

>
> $$
> \mathcal{M}^* \vDash P(\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}) \iff \lbrace i \in I : \mathcal{M}_i \vDash P(a_i, b_i) \rbrace \in \mathcal{U}
> $$
>

When defining operations and predicates on the ultraproduct, one must show that the results of operations and predicates are the same regardless of which element is chosen as a representative in the equivalence class. This follows readily from the intersection property of $\mathcal{U}$, so we leave it as an exercise.

We can now redefine the hypernatural numbers as the ultraproduct arising when $I, \mathcal{U}, \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{M}_i$ are respectively:

- $I = \mathbb{N}$
- $\mathcal{U} =$ Fréchet ultrafilter
- $\mathcal{L} = (0, S, <)$
- $\mathcal{M}_i = \mathbb{N}$

Similarly, we can define the **hyperreal numbers**:

- $I = \mathbb{N}$
- $\mathcal{U} =$ Fréchet ultrafilter
- $\mathcal{L} = (0, 1, +, ⋅, <)$
- $\mathcal{M}_i = \mathbb{R}$

## 7. Łoś's Theorem

> **Łoś's Theorem.** Given an ultraproduct $\mathcal{M}^* = \prod \mathcal{M}_i / \mathcal{U}$, for any $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\phi$, the following holds:
>
> $$
> \mathcal{M}^* \vDash \phi \iff \lbrace i \in I : \mathcal{M}_i \vDash \phi \rbrace \in \mathcal{U}
> $$

_Proof._ We prove this by structural induction on $\phi$.

#### 1. $\phi$ is an atomic proposition

This follows trivially from the definition of predicates on ultraproducts.

#### 2. $\phi := \psi \land \theta$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\mathcal{M}^* ⊨ φ\\
&\iff \mathcal{M}^* ⊨ ψ \land \mathcal{M}^* ⊨ θ\\
&\iff \lbrace i ∈ I \mid \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ ψ \rbrace ∈ \mathcal{U} \land \lbrace i ∈ I \mid \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ θ \rbrace ∈ \mathcal{U} &&(*)
\\
&\iff \lbrace i ∈ I \mid \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ ψ \rbrace \cap \lbrace i ∈ I \mid \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ θ \rbrace ∈ \mathcal{U} &&(**) \\
&\iff \lbrace i ∈ I \mid \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ ψ \land \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ θ \rbrace ∈ \mathcal{U}\\
&\iff \lbrace i ∈ I \mid \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ ψ∧θ \rbrace ∈ \mathcal{U}\\
&\iff \lbrace i ∈ I \mid \mathcal{M}_i ⊨ φ \rbrace ∈ \mathcal{U}
\end{aligned}
$$

$(*)$ holds by the inductive hypothesis, and $(**)$ holds by the intersection closure property of $\mathcal{U}$.

#### 3. $\phi := \lnot \psi$

This can be proved by a similar method to case 2, using the inductive hypothesis and the ultrafilter property of $\mathcal{U}$ ($A \in \mathcal{U} \lor A^c \in \mathcal{U}$).

#### 4. $\phi := \exists x\; \psi$

This can be proved by a similar method to case 2, though the inductive hypothesis alone suffices.

Since every proposition can be constructed from cases 1, 2, 3, and 4, the theorem is proved by induction. ■

> **Corollary.** $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}^*$ are elementarily equivalent.

_Proof._ By Łoś's theorem, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathbb{N}^* \vDash \phi$ is that $\lbrace i \in \mathbb{N} : \mathbb{N}^\ast\_i \vDash \phi \rbrace \in \mathcal{U}$. However, since $\mathbb{N}^*_i = \mathbb{N}$, the necessary and sufficient condition reduces to $\mathbb{N} \vDash \phi$. ■
