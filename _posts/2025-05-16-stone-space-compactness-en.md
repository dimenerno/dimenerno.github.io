The following is a famous theorem from undergraduate mathematical logic.

> **Compactness Theorem.** For a theory $T$ in language $\mathcal{L}$, if every finite subtheory of $T$ has a model, then $T$ has a model.

But why is this theorem called the compactness theorem? Upon closer examination, the statement of the above theorem can be written as follows:

> If an arbitrary set of $\mathcal{L}$-sentences $T$ has no model, then there exists some finite subset $T' \subset T$ such that $T'$ has no model.

This is certainly similar to the definition of compactness in topology.

> If an arbitrary collection of open sets $\mathcal{C}$ covers the entire space, then there exists some finite subset $\mathcal{C}' \subset \mathcal{C}$ such that $\mathcal{C}'$ covers the entire space.

This similarity can be extended beyond mere observation. The idea is to regard each complete $\mathcal{L}$-theory as a point in a space, and when we endow this collection with an appropriate topology, the compactness theorem becomes a necessary and sufficient condition for the corresponding space to be compact. First, we define the following:

> **Definition.** For an $\mathcal{L}$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$, we define $\mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A})$ as the set of all $\mathcal{L}$-sentences that are true in $\mathfrak{A}$.

Incidentally, this set was defined in a [previous post](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/05/01/elementary-embedding/) when explaining elementary equivalence.

It is clear that $\mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A})$ is a consistent and syntactically complete theory. Conversely, when a theory $T$ is consistent and syntactically complete, by Gödel's completeness theorem, $T$ has a model $\mathfrak{A}$, and $T = \mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A})$. Therefore, $\mathrm{Th}$ generates all consistent and syntactically complete theories.

Now let us define the space that will serve as the background for our topological space. First, for a language $\mathcal{L}$, we define the space $\mathcal{S}$ as follows:

$$
\mathcal{S} = \{ \mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A}) : \mathfrak{A}\text{ is a $\mathcal{L}$-structure } \}
$$

As mentioned earlier, by Gödel's completeness theorem, $\mathcal{S}$ is essentially the same as the collection of consistent and syntactically complete theories. However, as we shall see later, since our goal is to show that the topological compactness of $\mathcal{S}$ is equivalent to the compactness theorem of first-order logic without using the completeness theorem, it is better to think of $\mathcal{S}$ simply as a collection of $\mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A})$ for now.

Now let us define a topological basis for $\mathcal{S}$. For an $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\phi$, we define:

$$
U_\phi = \{ T \in \mathcal{S} : \phi \in T \}
$$

Trivially, $U\_\phi \cap U\_\psi = U\_{\phi \land \psi}$. That is, the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of $U\_\phi$ is closed under finite intersections. Moreover, $\mathcal{B}$ covers $\mathcal{S}$. For $T \in \mathcal{S}$, if $\phi \in T$, then $T \in U\_\phi$. Therefore, $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies the conditions for a topological basis, and we endow $\mathcal{S}$ with the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$.

> **Theorem.** $\mathcal{S}$ has the following properties:
>
> 1. It is Hausdorff.
> 2. It is a totally disconnected space. That is, the only connected subspaces in $\mathcal{S}$ are singleton sets.

**Proof.**

1. For $T\_1, T\_2 \in \mathcal{S}$, if $T\_1 \neq T\_2$, then there exists some sentence $\phi$ such that $\phi \in T\_1$ and $\lnot\phi \in T\_2$. Therefore, $U\_\phi$ and $U\_{\lnot \phi}$ separate $T\_1$ and $T\_2$ respectively.
2. A sufficient condition for a space to be totally disconnected is to have a basis where every element is clopen. Since $U\_\phi^c =U\_{\lnot \phi}$, $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies this condition. ■

> **Theorem.** The compactness theorem of first-order logic is equivalent to $\mathcal{S}$ being a compact space.

**Proof.**

> **Lemma.** A necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{B}$ to cover $\mathcal{S}$ is that $\Gamma = \lbrace \lnot \phi : U\_\phi \in \mathcal{C} \rbrace $ has no model.

_Proof._ If $\Gamma$ has a model $\mathfrak{A}$, then $T = \mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A})$ is not covered by $\mathcal{C}$. On the other hand, if $\mathcal{C}$ does not cover $\mathcal{S}$, then there exists some structure $\mathfrak{A}$ such that for $\phi \in \Gamma$, $\phi \notin \mathfrak{A}$, which means that $\mathfrak{A}$ is a model of $\Gamma$. □

Now we prove the main theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathcal{S}$ to be compact is that any cover of $\mathcal{S}$ consisting of basis elements has a finite subcover. For $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{B}$, a necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathcal{C}$ to cover $\mathcal{S}$ is (by the lemma) that $\Gamma$ has no model. Therefore,

$\mathcal{S}$ is compact

$\Leftrightarrow$ If any collection of basis elements $\mathcal{C}$ is a cover, then there exists a finite subcover.

$\Leftrightarrow$ If any theory $\Gamma$ has no model, then there exists a finite subtheory that has no model.

$\Leftrightarrow$ Compactness theorem ■

> **Definition.** A compact Hausdorff space that is totally disconnected is called a **Stone space**.

By the compactness theorem of first-order logic, $\mathcal{S}$ is a Stone space. This approach of analysing logical structures topologically is connected to a deep topic in modern mathematics called **Stone duality**.
