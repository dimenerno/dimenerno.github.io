These are illustrations I made when I studied classical mechanics in my BA. They seem to be well-made, so I decided to share them here, too.

Note that decomposing Revolution as the sum of Rotation about CM and Rotation about Axis is a specific case of the central axis theorem.

Note that when analysing Rolling from CM's frame, the ground also moves at $v = -r\omega$.
