### Problem

Find all positive integers $a, n$ such that

$$
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{a+1} + \dots + \frac{1}{a+n}
$$

is an integer.

### Solution

We claim that there is no integer $a, n$ such that the given expression evaluates to an integer. Choose $a, n$ arbitrarily. Define $f$ as follows.

$$
f(k) = \operatorname{argmax}_x (2^x \mid k)
$$

Define $m$ as follows.

$$
m = \operatorname{argmax}_{a \leq k \leq a + n} f(k)
$$

Note that since $n \geq 1$, $m$ is even. Note also that the above definition is well-defined, i.e. the argmax is a singleton. Indeed, if we have $f(m) = f(m') = k$ for $m \neq m'$, then we have $m = 2^k \cdot o,$ $m' = 2^k \cdot o'$ where $o, o'$ are both odd. Hence there exists an even number $e$ between $o$ and $o'$. It follows that $f(2^k \cdot e) > k$, so $m$ is not in the argmax of $f$.

Let $L$ be the least common multiple of $a, a + 1, \dots, a + n$. We have $f(L) = f(m)$, and for all other integers $k$ between $a$ and $a + n$ inclusive, $f(L) > f(k)$. Hence,

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{a} + \dots + \frac{1}{a+n} &= \frac{\overbrace{ \frac{L}{a} + \dots + \frac{L}{m-1} }^{ \text{even} } + \overbrace{\frac{L}{m}}^{\text{odd}} + \overbrace{\frac{L}{m+1} + \dots + \frac{L}{a + n}}^{\text{even}} }{L} \\
&= \frac{N}{L}
\end{align}
$$

where $N$ is odd. Since $L$ is even, $N/L \not\in \mathbb{Z}$. $\quad \blacksquare$
