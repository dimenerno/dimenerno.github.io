### 1. Baire Spaces

> **Theorem.** Let $S$ be a subset of a topological space $X$. The following are equivalent:

> - $(\operatorname{cl}S)^c$ is dense.
> - $S$ is not dense in any open set of $X$.

> **Definition.** A space $X$ is called a Baire space if every countable union $\bigcup F\_n$ of rare closed sets is rare.

*Remark.* TFAE:
- $X$ is a Baire space.
- Every countable intersection of open dense sets in $X$ is dense.

**Example.** $\mathbb{Q}$ is not a Baire space.
- $\lbrace  q \rbrace$ is a closed rare set, but $\bigcup\_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} \lbrace q\rbrace = \mathbb{Q}$ is not rare.
- $\mathbb{Q} \setminus \lbrace  q \rbrace$ is an open dense set, but $\bigcap\_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} \left( \mathbb{Q} \setminus \lbrace  q \rbrace  \right) = \varnothing$ is not dense.

### 2. The Baire Category Theorem

> **Cantor's Theorem on Compact Spaces.** The following are equivalent:
>
> 1. $X$ is compact.
> 2. For any collection $\mathcal{C}$ of closed sets with the finite intersection property, $\bigcap\_{C \in \mathcal{C}} C \neq \varnothing$.

> **Cantor's Theorem on Complete Metric Spaces.** The following are equivalent:
>
> 3. $X$ is a complete metric space.
> 4. For any non-empty decreasing sequence of closed sets $C\_1 \supset C\_2 \supset \cdots$, we have $\bigcap C\_n \neq \varnothing$, and in particular, when $\operatorname{diam}C\_n \to 0$, $\bigcap C\_n$ is a singleton.

*Remark.* Statement 2 implies statement 4. From this, one can show that compact metric spaces are complete. **The converse does not hold.**

> **Theorem.** Complete metric spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces are Baire spaces.

**Proof.** 

Let $X$ be a complete metric space or a compact Hausdorff space. Given a countable collection $\lbrace  F\_n \rbrace$ of rare closed sets, we shall show that for any open set $U$, we have $U \not\subset \bigcup F\_n$. To this end, we shall find $x \in U$ such that $\forall n : x \not\in F\_n$.

Since $F\_1$ is rare, there exists $x\_1 \in U \setminus F\_1$. As $X$ is a regular space, there exists an open set $U\_1$ such that $x\_1 \in U\_1$ and $\overline{U\_1} \cap F\_1 = \varnothing$. Inductively, we may define:

- $x\_n \in U\_n \setminus F\_n$
- $U\_n \subset U\_{n - 1}$
- $\overline{U\_n} \cap F\_n = \varnothing$

By Cantor's theorem, there exists $x \in \bigcap \overline{U\_n}$.

### 3. Applications of the Baire Category Theorem

> **Convergence of continuous function sequences is almost continuous.** Let $\lbrace  f\_n : X → (Y, d) \rbrace$ be a sequence of continuous functions converging to $f$. Then

> $$
> S = \lbrace  x \in X : f\text{ is continuous at } x \rbrace
> $$

> is dense in $X$.

> **KAIST POW2024-20.** Let $f$ be a continuous function such that
>
> $$
> \forall x \geq 0 : \lim_{n \to \infty} f(nx) = 0
> $$

> Then $\lim\_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 0$.

> **Existence of pathological functions.** Let $h : [0, 1] → \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. For any $ε > 0$, there exists a function $g : [0,1] → \mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
>
> - $\lVert h − g\rVert < ε$.
> - $g$ is continuous on the entire interval.
> - $g$ is differentiable nowhere.
