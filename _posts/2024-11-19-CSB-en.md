> **Theorem.** For two sets $X, Y$, if $\|X\| \leq \|Y\|$ and $\|X\| \geq \|Y\|$, then $\|X\| = \|Y\|$.

Although this may seem obvious, it requires some delicate function handling, since $\leq$ is defined by the existence of an injective function, while $=$ is defined by the existence of a bijective function.

As a side note, the theorem is often called the "Cantor–Bernstein theorem" or the "Schröder–Bernstein theorem", but I’ve never seen it called the "Cantor–Schröder theorem." If you're feeling a bit pretentious, it's an open option.

### First Proof

<img src="/public/csb-1.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin: 2em auto;">

By assumption there exists $f: X \to Y, g: Y \to X$ injective. If $Z := \mathrm{Im} f$ equals $Y$, the proof is done, so let us assume $Z \subsetneq Y$.

For any $y \in Z \setminus Y$ (represented as an empty dot in the diagram),

- let $x\_1^y = g^{-1}(y)$
- let $x\_{n+1}^y = g(f(x\_n))$

Now define a function $h: X \to Y$ as follows:

- $h\_y(x\_1^y) = y$
- $h\_y(x\_{n+1}^y) = f(x\_n)$

Check that the following holds:

$$
x^y_n = x^z_m \iff y = z, n = m
$$

Thus, the function $h: X \to Y$ defined by

$$
h(x) = \begin{cases}
h_y(x) &x = x^y_n \text{ for some } y, n \\\\
f(x) &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

is well-defined. Verify that $h$ is bijective. ◾

### Second Proof

> **Lemma (Sandwich Theorem for Cardinals).** If $A\_1 \supseteq B \supseteq A\_2$ and $\|A\_1\| = \|A\_2\|$, then $\|A\_1\| = \|B\| = \|A\_2\|$.

**Proof.** Assume $f: A\_1 \to A\_2$ is bijective. Let $B\_1 = B$. Define the sequences $\lbrace A_n\rbrace , \lbrace B_n\rbrace , \lbrace C_n\rbrace$ as follows:

$$
\begin{gather}
A_{n+1} = f[A_n]\\
B_{n+1} = f[B_n]\\
C_n = A_n \setminus B_n
\end{gather}
$$

Let $C = \bigcup C\_n$ (the unshaded region in the diagram) and $D = A\_1 \setminus C$ (the shaded region). Verify that $f[C] \subset C$ and $f[D] \subset D$. Then, define $g: B\_1 \to A\_2$ as follows (represented as arrows in the diagram).

$$
g(x) = \begin{cases}
x & x \in C\\
f(x) & x \in D
\end{cases}
$$

Then $g$ is bijective.

**Proof of the main theorem.** Given $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ are injective, we have $gf[X] \subseteq g[Y] \subseteq X$ and $\| gf[X] \| = \| X \|$. By the lemma, we obtain $\|g[Y]\| = \|Y\| = \|X\|$. ◾

Upon closer reflection, the two proofs are essentially the same.
