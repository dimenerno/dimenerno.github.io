The key principle in Cantor's back-and-forth argument, which demonstrates that all countable dense unbounded linear orders are isomorphic, is the following.

> **Countable Dedekind Property.** Let $(L, <)$ be a linear order. The following are equivalent:
>
> 1. $(L, <)$ is dense and unbounded.
> 2. For finite subsets $C, D$ of $L$, if $C < D$ then there exists $y \in L$ such that $C < y < D$.

Here $C < D$ is shorthand notation for $\forall c \in C, d \in D : c < d$.

From the finite Dedekind property, the isomorphism theorem can be proved as follows. Let $(A, <_A), (B, <_B)$ be two countable dense unbounded linear orders. Since they are countable, the elements of $A, B$ can be indexed by natural numbers. Define $f: A \to B$ inductively as follows:

1. Set $f(a_0) = b_0$ and let $n = 1$.
2. Check whether $a_n \in \mathrm{dom} f$.
    1. If $a_n \in \mathrm{dom} f$, proceed to step 3.
    2. If $a_n \notin \mathrm{dom} f$, by the lemma there exists $y \in B$ such that $C < y < D$ for $C = \lbrace f(a_k) : k < n, a_k <_A a_n \rbrace$ and $D = \lbrace f(a_k) : k < n, a_k >_A a_n \rbrace$. Define $f(a_n) = y$.
3. Check whether $b_n \in \mathrm{ran} f$.
    1. If $b_n \in \mathrm{ran} f$, proceed to step 4.
    2. If $b_n \notin \mathrm{ran} f$, by the lemma there exists $x \in A$ such that $C < x < D$ for $C = \lbrace f^{-1}(b_k) : k < n, b_k <_B b_n \rbrace$ and $D = \lbrace f^{-1}(b_k) : k < n, b_k >_B b_n \rbrace$. Define $f(x) = b_n$.
4. Update $n$ to $n + 1$ and return to step 2.

The function $f$ obtained as the inductive limit of the above process is an isomorphism between $A$ and $B$.

However, the following generalisation of the above lemma does not hold in general.

> **(False Statement)** Let $(L, <)$ be a linear order. The following are equivalent:
>
> 1. $(L, <)$ is dense and unbounded.
> 2. For subsets $C, D$ of $L$ with cardinality less than that of $L$, if $C < D$ then there exists $y \in L$ such that $C < y < D$.

For example, $(\mathbb{R} \setminus \lbrace 0 \rbrace, <)$ is a dense unbounded linear order, and when $C = (-\infty, 0) \cap \mathbb{Q}$ and $D = (0, \infty) \cap \mathbb{Q}$, we have $C < D$ and $\|C\|, \|D\| < \|\mathbb{R}\|$, but there exists no real number $y$ satisfying $C < y < D$.

If the generalisation of the above lemma held, one could prove the uniqueness of dense unbounded linear orders of cardinality $\kappa > \aleph_0$ as follows. Assuming the axiom of choice, $A$ and $B$ can be well-ordered to be order-isomorphic to $\kappa$. Now define $f$ by transfinite induction for ordinals $\alpha < \kappa$.

1. Set $f(a_0) = b_0$ and let $\alpha = 1$.
2. Check whether $a_\alpha \in \mathrm{dom} f$.
    1. If $a_\alpha \in \mathrm{dom} f$, proceed to step 3.
    2. If $a_\alpha \notin \mathrm{dom} f$, by the generalised lemma there exists $y \in B$ such that $C < y < D$ for $C = \lbrace f(a_\beta) : \beta < \alpha, a_\beta <_A a_\alpha \rbrace$ and $D = \lbrace f(a_\beta) : \beta < \alpha, a_\beta >_A a_\alpha \rbrace$. Define $f(a_\alpha) = y$.
3. Check whether $b_\alpha \in \mathrm{ran} f$.
    1. If $b_\alpha \in \mathrm{ran} f$, proceed to step 4.
    2. If $b_\alpha \notin \mathrm{ran} f$, by the generalised lemma there exists $x \in A$ such that $C < x < D$ for $C = \lbrace f^{-1}(b_\beta) : \beta < \alpha, b_\beta <_B b_\alpha \rbrace$ and $D = \lbrace f^{-1}(b_\beta) : \beta < \alpha, b_\beta >_B b_\alpha \rbrace$. Define $f(x) = b_\alpha$.
4. Complete $f$ by transfinite induction.

However, since the generalised lemma does not hold, Cantor's back-and-forth argument cannot be applied to show that uncountable dense unbounded linear orders are unique. Indeed, uncountable dense unbounded linear orders are not unique—besides $\mathbb{R}$, there are others such as the lexicographic order on $\lbrace 0\rbrace \times \mathbb{R} \sqcup \lbrace 1\rbrace \times \mathbb{Q}$.

To what extent can the property of the lemma be generalised? The concept related to this question is as follows.

> **Definition.**
>
> 1. A family of sets $\mathcal{C}$ has the **finite intersection property** if the finite intersection of set-elements from $\mathcal{C}$ is always non-empty.
> 2. A family of sets $\mathcal{C}$ is **resilient** if, whenever $\mathcal{D}$ is a subfamily of $\mathcal{C}$ with the finite intersection property, we have $\bigcap_{D \in \mathcal{D}} D \neq \varnothing$.

Readers familiar with topology will recognise this as a familiar concept.

> **Cantor's Nested Interval Theorem.** $K$ is compact if and only if every collection $\mathcal{F}$ of closed subsets of $K$ is resilient.

**Proof.** $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is not resilient. Then there exists a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of closed sets such that $\mathcal{C}$ has the finite intersection property but $\bigcap_{C \in \mathcal{C}} C = \varnothing$. By De Morgan's laws, $\bigcup_{C \in \mathcal{C}} C^c = K$. That is, $\lbrace C^c : C \in \mathcal{C} \rbrace$ is an open cover of $K$. Since $K$ is compact, this has a finite subcover. However, in this case, again by De Morgan's laws, for some finite $\mathcal{C}' \subset \mathcal{C}$ we have $\bigcap_{C \in \mathcal{C}'} C = \varnothing$. This contradicts the finite intersection property of $\mathcal{C}$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ The proof follows in almost exactly the same manner. ■

We can now generalise the lemma as follows.

> **Uncountable Dedekind Property.** Let $(L, <)$ be a linear order and let $\kappa$ be an uncountable cardinal. The following are equivalent:
>
> 1. $(L, <)$ is dense and unbounded. Moreover, any collection of fewer than $\kappa$ open intervals and half-lines is resilient.
> 2. For subsets $C, D$ of $L$, if $\|C\|, \|D\| < \kappa$ and $C < D$, then there exists $y \in L$ such that $C < y < D$.

**Proof.** $(\Rightarrow)$

#### i. $D = \varnothing$

Consider $\mathcal{C} = \lbrace (c, \infty) : c \in C \rbrace$. Since $\|\mathcal{C}\| = \|C\| < \kappa$, by the premise $\mathcal{C}$ is resilient. Since $\mathcal{C}$ has the finite intersection property, $\bigcap_{c \in C} (c, \infty) = (c', \infty)$. This $c'$ is the desired $y$.

#### ii. $C = \varnothing$

Almost identical to case i.

#### iii. $C, D \neq \varnothing$

Consider $\mathcal{E} = \lbrace (c, d) : c \in C, d \in D \rbrace$. By the cardinal arithmetic $\lambda \cdot \epsilon = \mathrm{max}(\lambda, \epsilon)$, we have $\|\mathcal{E}\| < \kappa$, and $\mathcal{E}$ is resilient. Since $\mathcal{E}$ has the finite intersection property ($\because$ countable Dedekind property), $\bigcap_{c \in C, d \in D} (c, d) = (c', d')$. Since $(c', d') \neq \varnothing$, there exists $y \in (c', d')$, which is the desired $y$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ That $(L, <)$ is dense and unbounded is trivial.

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a collection of fewer than $\kappa$ open intervals and half-lines. Suppose $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{E}$ has the finite intersection property. Then for $C = \lbrace c : (c, d) \in \mathcal{F} \text{ or } (c, \infty) \in \mathcal{F} \rbrace$ and $D = \lbrace d : (c, d) \in \mathcal{F} \text{ or } (-\infty, d) \in \mathcal{F}\rbrace$, we have $C < D$. Otherwise, for some $c' \in C, d' \in D$ we would have $d' < c'$, in which case for an open interval $(c', d'') \in \mathcal{F}$ with left endpoint $c'$ and an open interval $(c'', d') \in \mathcal{F}$ with right endpoint $d'$, we would have $(c', d'') \cap (c'', d') = \varnothing$, contradicting the finite intersection property of $\mathcal{F}$.

Therefore $C < D$, and by the condition there exists $y$ such that $C < y < D$. From this it follows that $y \in \bigcap_{I \in \mathcal{F}} I$, showing that $\mathcal{E}$ is resilient. ■

> **Definition.** A set satisfying the uncountable Dedekind property is called an [**$\eta$ set**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Η_set). In particular, a set satisfying the uncountable Dedekind property for $\kappa = \aleph_\alpha$ is called an $\eta_\alpha$ set.

$\eta$ sets were introduced by Hausdorff. $\eta$ sets are closely related to the concept of **saturation**, which we shall explore in the following article.
