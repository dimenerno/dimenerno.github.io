In the [previous article](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/05/08/saturation/), we examined what sets are **definable** in an $\mathcal{L}$-structure $\mathfrak{A}$. When $S \subseteq A$ is definable by a formula $\phi$ belonging to a particular [arithmetic hierarchy](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/02/07/arithmetic-hierarchy/) in $\mathfrak{A}$, we say that $S$ belongs to that hierarchy. For instance, when $S$ is definable by a $\Pi\_1$ sentence, we have $S \in \Pi\_1$.

For example, in the standard arithmetic model $\mathfrak{N} = (\mathbb{N}, 0, S, +)$, the set of even numbers is $\Sigma\_1$.

$$
\{ x \in \mathbb{N} : \mathfrak{N} \vDash \exists y (y + y = x) \}
$$

Since the structure of sets becomes more complex as the hierarchy level increases, the most ideal situation is when all definable sets can be reduced to $\Delta\_0$. Theories possessing such a property are called theories admitting quantifier elimination.

> **Definition.** An $\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ **admits quantifier elimination** if for any $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\phi$, there exists some $\Delta\_0$ $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\psi$ such that the following holds:

> $$T \vdash \phi \leftrightarrow \psi$$

> where all free variables of $\psi$ are free variables of $\phi$.

> **Quantifier Elimination Test.** A sufficient condition for $T$ to admit quantifier elimination is that $T$ admits quantifier elimination for formulae of the form $\exists x \psi$ where $\psi \in \Delta_0$.

**Proof.** First, we show that for any $\Delta_0$ formula $\psi$, the formula $\forall x \psi$ admits quantifier elimination. The formula $\forall x \psi$ is equivalent to $\lnot\exists x \lnot \psi$, and by assumption, $\exists x \lnot \psi$ is equivalent to some quantifier-free formula $\theta$. Therefore, $\forall x \psi$ is equivalent to $\lnot \theta$ and admits quantifier elimination. By applying induction on the number of quantifiers, we can show that quantifier elimination is possible for any formula. ■

When a theory admits quantifier elimination, it is often possible to show that the theory is complete. Consider the following example.

> **Theorem.** The theory $T$ of dense unbounded linear orders admits quantifier elimination.

**Proof.** First, we define the following concept.

> **Definition.** An **arrangement** of finite variables is a consistent conjunction of order relations amongst the variables.

For instance, the following is an arrangement of $\lbrace v_1, v_3, v_7, v_8 \rbrace$:

$$
(v_1 < v_3) \land (v_8 \land v_7) \land (v_3 = v_8)
$$

The key to the proof is the following lemma.

> **Lemma.** A $\Delta_0$ formula in $\mathcal{L} = (<)$ is either equivalent to a contradiction in the theory of linear orders, or equivalent to a disjunction of arrangements.

Accepting the lemma, we prove the main theorem. By the quantifier elimination test, it suffices to show that $\exists x \psi$ admits quantifier elimination for $\psi \in \Delta_0$. By the lemma, $\psi$ is equivalent to $\theta_1 \lor \cdots \lor \theta_n$, where each $\theta_i$ is an arrangement of variables. By the distributivity of $\exists$, we have

$$
T \vdash \exists x \psi \leftrightarrow \Big( (\exists x \theta_1) \lor \cdots (\exists x \theta_n) \Big)
$$

However, in dense unbounded linear orders, for an arrangement $\theta$, the formula $\exists x \theta$ is equivalent to the formula obtained by writing out the order relations of $\theta$ in a single line and then removing $x$. For example, $\exists x (v_1 < x) \land (x < v_2)$ can be written as $\exists x (v_1 < x < v_2)$, which by density is equivalent to $v_1 < v_2$. On the other hand, $\exists x (v_1 < x)$ is a tautology by unboundedness and is equivalent to $v_1 = v_1$. Therefore, the right-hand side of the above equation admits quantifier elimination, and consequently $\exists x \psi$ also admits quantifier elimination. ■

> **Corollary.** $T$ is complete.

**Proof.** Since $T$ admits quantifier elimination, by the standard quantifier elimination procedure, it suffices to show that for any $\Delta_0$ sentence $\psi \in \Delta_0$ with at most one free variable $x$, either $T \vdash \psi$ or $T \vdash \lnot\psi$. By the lemma, $\psi$ is equivalent to an arrangement of $x$. However, there are only two possible arrangements of $x$: $x < x$ and $x = x$. In the former case, since it is a contradiction, we have $T \vdash \lnot\psi$; in the latter case, since it is a tautology, we have $T \vdash \psi$. ■

In contrast to $T$ admitting quantifier elimination, the theory $T_{\mathrm{bd}}$ of dense bounded linear orders does not admit quantifier elimination. This is because when $a$ is the minimum element of $<$, the formula $\phi \equiv \exists y (y < x)$ does not admit quantifier elimination. Since $T_{\mathrm{bd}}$ is also a theory of linear orders, if $\phi$ admitted quantifier elimination, then by the lemma, $\phi$ would have to be equivalent to either $x < x$ or $x = x$. However, $\phi$ is true when $x = a$ and false otherwise, so it corresponds to neither case.

Nevertheless, in this case we can easily find an extension of $T_{\mathrm{bd}}$ that admits quantifier elimination. First, we add two new constant symbols $a$ and $b$ to the language $\mathcal{L}$. Then we define $T_{\mathrm{bd}}'$ as $T_{\mathrm{bd}}$ with the addition of the following axioms stating that $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and maximum elements, respectively:

$$
\lnot \exists (x < a) \quad \lnot \exists (b < x)
$$

> **Theorem.** $T_{\mathrm{bd}}'$ admits quantifier elimination.

**Proof.** Exercise.

> **Corollary.** $T_{\mathrm{bd}}$ is complete.

**Proof.** Since $T_{\mathrm{bd}}'$, which is a conservative extension of $T_{\mathrm{bd}}$, is complete, $T_{\mathrm{bd}}$ is also complete. ■
