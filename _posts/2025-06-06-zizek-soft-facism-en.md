This post is originally a Korean translation of [Slavoj Žižek's Oxford lecture](https://youtu.be/OSYjmH_WPQQ?si=9Rb5ToZSwf0qg7gx), so there is no separate English version. However, the following personal observation from the original post is reproduced here.

> Perversion manifests as unconscious positivity, encompassing concepts such as freedom, laissez-faire, action, and activity, whilst hysteria manifests as unconscious negativity, encompassing concepts such as repression, constraint, prohibition, and passivity. In this lecture, Žižek appears to subsume "soft fascism" (the pathological fusion of ideology and capitalism), artificial intelligence, and the "explosion of shamelessness" under the category of perversion, namely the blind manifestation of positivity.
