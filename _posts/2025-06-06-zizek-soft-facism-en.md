This post is originally a Korean translation of [Slavoj Žižek's Oxford lecture](https://youtu.be/OSYjmH_WPQQ?si=9Rb5ToZSwf0qg7gx), so there is no separate English version. However, the following personal observation from the original post is reproduced here.

> Psychoanalytically, **Perversion** is a manifestation of subconscious positivity whilst **hysteria** is a manifestation of subconscious negativity. **Positivity** encompasses concepts such as freedom, laissez-faire, liveliness, and activity, while **negativity** encompasses concepts such as repression, constraint, prohibition, and passivity. In this lecture, Žižek appears to subsume "soft fascism" — the pathological fusion of ideology and capitalism, — artificial intelligence, and the rise of Shamelessness under the category of perversion, namely the uncontrolled manifestation of positivity.
