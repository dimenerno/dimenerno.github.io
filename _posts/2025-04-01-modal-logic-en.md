The logics become strictly stronger as one moves down the table.

### Completeness Theorem

> **Theorem.** **K** is complete.

**Proof.**

> **Lindenbaum's Lemma.** Any consistent theory can be extended to a maximally consistent theory.

The completeness statement is equivalent to "every consistent theory is satisfiable", and applying Lindenbaum's lemma, this is equivalent to "every maximally consistent theory is satisfiable".

Let $u, v$ be maximally consistent theories. We write $u \lhd v$ when $\Box p \in u \implies p \in v$. The following can be shown without difficulty:

- When $u \lhd v$, we have $p \in v \implies \Diamond p \in u$
- For any maximally consistent theory $u$, if $p \in u$ and $\Box p \notin u$, then there exist maximally consistent theories $v, v'$ such that $p \in v, \lnot p \in v'$ and $u \lhd v, v'$.

From this, for a maximally consistent theory $u$, we can define the **canonical Kripke model** $\mathfrak{K} = (U, \prec, V)$ as follows:

- The collection of possible worlds $U$ is the collection of $v$ satisfying $u \lhd v$.
- The accessibility relation $\prec$ is $\lhd$.
- The valuation function $V(p, v)$ is true if and only if $p \in v$.

It can be shown without difficulty that $\mathfrak{K}$ satisfies $u$. ■
