In this article, $T$ is a theory in language $\mathcal{L}$. We also write $x_1, \dots, x_n$ as $\vec{x}$.

**Examples**

1. The theory of fields is not model complete. For the real field $\mathbb{R}$ and the rational field $\mathbb{Q}$, we have $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ but $\mathbb{Q} \not\preceq \mathbb{R}$ since the truth value of $\exists x (x \cdot x = 2)$ differs in the two models.

2. The theory of torsion-free divisible abelian groups is model complete.

3. Theories admitting quantifier elimination are model complete.

One useful theorem for determining model completeness, including case 2 above, is the following.

### Proof

#### (1) → (2)

Since $T$ is model complete, if $\mathfrak{A} \subseteq \mathfrak{B}$ then $\mathfrak{A} \preceq \mathfrak{B}$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are equivalent with respect to $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-sentences. □

#### (2) → (3)

Suppose $\phi(\vec{x})$ is a $\Sigma_1(\mathcal{L})$-formula. Let $\mathcal{L}'$ be the language obtained by adding constants $\vec{c}$ to $\mathcal{L}$. We can view $T$ as an $\mathcal{L}'$-theory and consider $\mathfrak{A} \subseteq \mathfrak{B}$ as an embedding of $\mathcal{L}'$-structures.

Now consider the $\mathcal{L}'$-theory $T' = T \cup \{ \phi(\vec{c}) \}$. Suppose $\mathfrak{B}$ is a model of $T'$. We show that $\mathfrak{A}$ is also a model of $T'$. Since $\mathfrak{A} \subseteq \mathfrak{B}$ is an embedding of $\mathcal{L}'$-structures, observe that:

$$
\mathfrak{B} \vDash \phi(\vec{c}) \iff \exists \vec{a} \in \mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}  \text{ where } \mathfrak{B} \vDash \phi(\vec{a})
$$

Since $\phi(\vec{a})$ is a $\Sigma_1(\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A})$-sentence, by assumption it also holds in $\mathfrak{A}$. Therefore, $\mathfrak{A}$ is a model of $T'$.

We now use the following generalisation of the [Łoś-Tarski theorem](/2025/04/17/los-tarski) (proof left as an exercise).

> **Theorem.** Let $T \subseteq T'$ be $\mathcal{L}'$-theories such that:
>
> - For any models $\mathfrak{A} \subseteq \mathfrak{B}$ of $T$, if $\mathfrak{B}$ is a model of $T'$ then $\mathfrak{A}$ is also a model of $T'$.

> Then there exists a collection $P$ of $\Pi_1(\mathcal{L}')$-sentences such that $T'$ is equivalent to $T \cup P$.

By the theorem above, $T'$ is equivalent to $T \cup P$ for some collection $P$ of $\Pi_1(\mathcal{L}')$-sentences. That is,

$$
T \cup P \vdash \phi(\vec{c})
$$

By the finiteness of proofs, only finitely many sentences from $P$ are needed to prove $\phi$ from $T \cup P$. Let $\pi(\vec{c})$ be the conjunction of these sentences. Then

$$
T \vdash \forall x (\phi(\vec{x}) \leftrightarrow \pi(\vec{x}))
$$

and $\pi(\vec{x})$ is a $\Pi_1(\mathcal{L})$-formula, completing the proof for the case when $\phi \in \Sigma_1$.

We now prove by structural induction on $\phi$. Since $\exists \leftrightarrow \lnot\forall\lnot$, we need only consider $\lor, \lnot, \forall$. The cases for $\lor$ and $\forall$ are trivial, so we examine the case for $\lnot$.

Suppose for some $\Pi_1(\mathcal{L})$-formula $\psi$ we have $T \vdash \forall \vec{x} (\phi(\vec{x}) \leftrightarrow \psi(\vec{x}))$. Then $\lnot \phi$ is equivalent to $\lnot \psi$, which is a $\Sigma_1(\mathcal{L})$-formula. By the preceding argument, this is equivalent to a $\Pi_1$ sentence. □

#### (3) → (1)

For models $\mathfrak{A} \subseteq \mathfrak{B}$ of $T$, if $\mathfrak{A} \not\preceq \mathfrak{B}$ then by the compactness theorem there exists some $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-sentence $\phi(\vec{a})$ such that $\mathfrak{A} \not\vDash \phi(\vec{a})$ but $\mathfrak{B} \vDash \phi(\vec{a})$.

By assumption, there exists a $\Pi_1$ formula $\psi$ such that $T \vdash \forall \vec{x} (\phi(\vec{x}) \leftrightarrow \psi(\vec{x}))$. Therefore $\mathfrak{B} \vDash \psi(\vec{a})$. However, this is a $\Pi_1$ sentence, and $\Pi_1$ sentences are preserved under submodels, so $\mathfrak{A} \vDash \psi(\vec{a})$, which gives a contradiction. ■
