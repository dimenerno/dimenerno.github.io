For subgroups $H, K$ of a group $G$, the intersection $H \cap K$ is always a group. The same holds for rings and fields. This can be explained as a consequence of the Łoś-Tarski theorem.

> _Notation._ In this article, $T$ is a first-order theory in language $\mathcal{L}$, and Fraktur letters $\mathfrak{M}, \mathfrak{N}, \dots$ denote $\mathcal{L}$-structures. Furthermore, we write the domains of $\mathfrak{M}, \mathfrak{N}, \dots$ as $M, N, \dots$ respectively.

## Basic Concepts

> **Definition.** When $N \subseteq M$ and the interpretation in $\mathfrak{N}$ is the restriction of the interpretation in $\mathfrak{M}$ to $N$, we call $\mathfrak{N}$ a **submodel** of $\mathfrak{M}$, and write $\mathfrak{N} \subseteq \mathfrak{M}$. Furthermore, $\mathfrak{M}$ is called an **extension** of $\mathfrak{N}$.

For example, $(2\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is a submodel of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, and $(\mathbb{Q}, +, \cdot)$ is a submodel of $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)$.

> **Definition.** When $\mathfrak{M} \vDash \phi \iff \mathfrak{N} \vDash \phi$ for any $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\phi$, we say that $\mathfrak{M}$ and $\mathfrak{N}$ are **elementarily equivalent**, and write $\mathfrak{M} \equiv \mathfrak{N}$.

By the [Löwenheim-Skolem theorem](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/04/10/completeness-theorem/), if $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal at least $\|\mathcal{L}\|$, then for any infinite structure $\mathfrak{M}$, there exists a model $\mathfrak{N}$ of cardinality $\kappa$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\mathfrak{M}$. (cf. Łoś-Vaught test)

> **Definition.** When $\mathfrak{M}$ and $\mathfrak{N}$ are structurally identical, they are called **isomorphic**, written $\mathfrak{M} \cong \mathfrak{N}$. Specifically, $\mathfrak{M} \cong \mathfrak{N}$ when there exists a bijection $\phi: M \to N$ such that for any function $f$ and relation $R$ in $\mathcal{L}$, the following holds for any $a_1, \dots, a_n \in M$:
>
> $$
> \begin{gather}
> \phi(f_\mathfrak{M}(a_1, \dots, a_n)) = f_\mathfrak{N}(\phi(a_1), \dots, \phi(a_n)), \\\\
> R_\mathfrak{M}(a_1, \dots, a_n) \iff R_\mathfrak{N}(\phi(a_1), \dots, \phi(a_n))
> \end{gather}
> $$

$(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ and $(2\mathbb{Z}, +)$ are isomorphic via $\phi: x \mapsto 2x$, but $(\mathbb{Q}, +, \cdot)$ and $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)$ are not isomorphic.

The proof of the following theorem is almost trivial.

> **Theorem.** Two isomorphic structures are elementarily equivalent.

> **Definition.** Let $\mathfrak{N} \subseteq \mathfrak{M}$. When $\mathfrak{N} \vDash \phi[g] \iff \mathfrak{M} \vDash \phi[g]$ for any $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\phi$ and any assignment $g$ of free variables in $\mathfrak{N}$, we call $\mathfrak{N}$ an **elementary submodel** of $\mathfrak{M}$, and write $\mathfrak{N} \preceq \mathfrak{M}$.

Conditions 2 and 3 are stronger than 1, but 2 and 3 do not imply each other.

1. $\mathfrak{N} \subseteq \mathfrak{M}$, $\mathfrak{N} \equiv \mathfrak{M}$
2. $\mathfrak{N} \subseteq \mathfrak{M}$, $\mathfrak{N} \cong \mathfrak{M}$
3. $\mathfrak{N} \preceq \mathfrak{M}$

The reason why 2 and 3 do not imply each other is that 2 requires structural equivalence, making it no weaker than 3, whilst 3 requires equivalence for arbitrary assignments, making it no weaker than 2. For instance, for $\mathfrak{M} = (\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)$, for $\mathfrak{N}$ to be an isomorphic submodel of $\mathfrak{M}$, it must be _structurally_ identical with respect to _constructible_ real numbers, whereas for $\mathfrak{N}$ to be an elementary submodel of $\mathfrak{M}$, the two models must be _elementarily_ equivalent with respect to _all_ real numbers.

|                       | 2                       | 3                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 2 is no weaker than 3 | Structural identity     | Elementary identity   |
| 3 is no weaker than 2 | Constructible objects   | Arbitrary objects     |

For example, as we saw earlier, $(2\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is an isomorphic submodel of $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, but considering the assignment $x \mapsto 2$ for $\exists y \; (y + y = x)$, we can see that it is not an elementary submodel.

## The Łoś-Tarski Theorem

Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a model of $T$. What kind of theory must $T$ be for any submodel of $\mathfrak{M}$ to also be a model of $T$? The answer is given by the following theorem.

> **The Łoś-Tarski Preservation Theorem.** A necessary and sufficient condition for submodels of models of $T$ to also be models of $T$ is that $T$ is equivalent to a theory consisting of $\Pi_1$ sentences.

What $\Pi_1$ sentences are has been covered in the [arithmetic hierarchy](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/02/07/arithmetic-hierarchy/) article. To explain briefly, these are theories having only $\forall$ as quantifiers. Intuitively, $\Pi_1$ sentences become easier to satisfy as the domain is restricted, so if $T$ is a $\Pi_1$ theory, then $T$ will be preserved under submodels. The necessity is somewhat more challenging to prove.

**Proof.** The sufficiency is almost trivial, so we prove only the necessity. We prove the following lemma.

> **Lemma.** Let $T$ be a consistent theory in language $\mathcal{L}$. When a set $\Delta$ of $\mathcal{L}$-sentences satisfies the following two conditions, $\Delta$ contains an axiomatisation of $T$.
>
> 1. $\Delta$ is closed under disjunction. That is, if $\phi, \psi \in \Delta$, then $\phi \lor \psi \in \Delta$.
> 2. For a model $\mathfrak{A}$ of $T$, if $\mathfrak{B}$ satisfies all sentences in $\Delta$ that are satisfied in $\mathfrak{A}$, then $\mathfrak{B}$ is also a model of $T$.

_Proof of the lemma._ Let $\Gamma = \lbrace  \delta \in \Delta : T \vDash \delta \rbrace $. To show that $\Delta$ contains an axiomatisation of $T$, it suffices to show the following:

$$
\mathfrak{B} \vDash \Gamma \implies \mathfrak{B} \vDash T
$$

Suppose $\mathfrak{B}$ is a model of $\Gamma$. Define:

$$
\Sigma = \{ \lnot \delta : \delta \in \Delta, \mathfrak{B} \not\vDash \delta \}
$$

We show that $T \cup \Sigma$ is a consistent theory. If $T \cup \Sigma$ were inconsistent, then for some $\lnot\delta_1, \dots, \lnot\delta_n \in \Sigma$, we would have $T \vdash \lnot(\lnot\delta_1 \land \cdots \land \lnot\delta_n)$, so $T \vdash \delta_1 \lor \cdots \lor \delta_n$. Since $\Delta$ is closed under disjunction, $\delta_1 \lor \cdots \lor \delta_n \in \Delta$. By the definition of $\Gamma$, $\delta_1 \lor \cdots \lor \delta_n \in \Gamma$, so $\mathfrak{B} \vDash \delta_1 \lor \cdots \lor \delta_n$. This contradicts $\lnot\delta_1, \dots, \lnot\delta_n \in \Sigma$.

Since $T \cup \Sigma$ is consistent, by the completeness theorem it has a model. Let this model be $\mathfrak{A}$. Since $\mathfrak{B}$ satisfies all sentences in $\Delta$ that $\mathfrak{A}$ satisfies, by assumption $\mathfrak{B}$ is a model of $T$. □

Now we proceed to the proof of the main theorem. Let $\Delta$ be the set of all $\Pi_1$ sentences in $\mathcal{L}$. Our goal is to show that $\Delta$ contains an axiomatisation of $T$. Since $\Pi_1$ sentences are closed under disjunction, by the lemma it suffices to show the following:

> Let $T$ be a theory that is preserved under submodels. For a model $\mathfrak{A}$ of $T$, if $\mathfrak{B}$ satisfies all $\Pi_1$ sentences satisfied in $\mathfrak{A}$, then $\mathfrak{B}$ is also a model of $T$.

Following the notation from [this article](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/05/01/elementary-embedding/), let us define $E(\mathfrak{B})$. That is, $\mathfrak{M}$ satisfies $E(\mathfrak{B})$ when $\mathfrak{B} \preceq \mathfrak{M}$.

We show that $T \cup E(\mathfrak{B})$ is consistent. If $T \cup E(\mathfrak{B})$ were inconsistent, then there would exist some sentence $\phi(b_1, \dots, b_n)$ from $E(\mathfrak{B})$ such that $T \cup \lbrace  \phi \rbrace $ has no model. Therefore, $\mathfrak{A}$, being a model of $T$, cannot be extended to an $\mathcal{L} \cup \lbrace b_1, \dots, b_n \rbrace $ model that satisfies $\phi$. That is, the following holds:

$$
\mathfrak{A} \vDash \forall x_1 \cdots \forall x_n \lnot \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n)
$$

The right-hand side is a $\Pi_1$ sentence, so by assumption $\mathfrak{B} \vDash \forall x_1 \cdots \forall x_n \lnot \phi(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. However, since $\phi(b_1, \dots, b_n) \in E(\mathfrak{B})$, this is a contradiction. Therefore, $T \cup E(\mathfrak{B})$ is consistent and by the completeness theorem has a model $\mathfrak{C}$. Since $\mathfrak{C}$ satisfies $E(\mathfrak{B})$, we have $\mathfrak{B} \preceq \mathfrak{C}$. Meanwhile, since $\mathfrak{C}$ is a model of $T$, which is preserved under submodels, $\mathfrak{B}$ is a model of $T$. ■

## Applications

The first-order logical axiomatisation of groups differs depending on whether the identity element and inverse are represented as separate constant $e$ and function $(-)^{-1}$.

#### Without representation

Define theory $T_1$ in language $\mathcal{L}_1 = \lbrace  G, \cdot \rbrace $ as follows:

- $\forall x, y, z : (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$
- $\exists x \forall y : x \cdot y = y \cdot x = y$
- $\forall x \exists y \forall z : (x \cdot y) \cdot z = (y \cdot x) \cdot z = z$

#### With representation

Define theory $T_2$ in language $\mathcal{L}_2 = \lbrace  G, \cdot, e, (-)^{-1} \rbrace $ as follows:

- $\forall x, y, z : (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$
- $\forall x : x \cdot e = e \cdot x = x$
- $\forall x : x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = e$

$T_1$ is not a $\Pi_1$ theory, but $T_2$ is a $\Pi_1$ theory. Therefore, by the Łoś-Tarski theorem, $T_1$ is not submodel-preserving whilst $T_2$ is preserving. That $T_1$ is not submodel-preserving means that a subset of a group being closed under the operation does not always make it a subgroup<small>(for instance, the subset $\mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under the operation but is not a group as it lacks inverses)</small>. Conversely, that $T_2$ is submodel-preserving means the following holds:

> For a group $G$, if a subset $H$ of $G$ satisfies the following, then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$:
>
> 1. Closed under the operation.
> 2. Closed under inverses.
> 3. Contains the identity element of $G$.

However, the following stronger result generally holds:

> For a group $G$, if a subset $H$ of $G$ satisfies the following, then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$:
>
> 1. Closed under the operation.
> 2. Closed under inverses.

That is, even in language $\mathcal{L}_3 = \lbrace  G, \cdot, (-)^{-1} \rbrace$ lacking a constant to denote the identity element, the theory of groups is submodel-preserving, which means there exists a $\Pi_1$ theory formalising groups in $\mathcal{L}_3$. With some clever thinking, one can indeed discover that the following theory $T_3$ exists:

- $\forall x, y, z : (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$
- $\forall x, y : (x \cdot x^{-1}) \cdot y = y \cdot (x \cdot x^{-1}) = y$
