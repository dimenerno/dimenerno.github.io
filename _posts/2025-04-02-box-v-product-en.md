## Product Topology and Box Topology

The section on product topology and box topology in undergraduate topology presents a significant challenge for many students. Whilst the box topology appears far more intuitive at first glance, textbooks teach that the product topology is the more natural concept to work with than the box topology.

> **Definition.** For a collection of topological spaces $\lbrace  X\_i \rbrace \_{i \in I}$, the **box topological space** $\prod X\_i$ is the topological space generated by the following basis:

> \left\{ \prod U_i : U_i \text{ is open in } X_i \right\}

> **Definition.** For a collection of topological spaces $\lbrace  X\_i \rbrace \_{i \in I}$, the **product topological space** $\prod X\_i$ is the topological space generated by the following basis:

> \left\{ \prod U_i : U_i \text{ is open in } X_i,\;  U_i \neq X_i \text{ for only finitely many } i\right\}

For instance, the neighbourhoods of $(1, 1, 1, \dots)$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ are as follows:

Why is the product topology considered more natural than the box topology? The reason is related to how products of objects are defined in category theory.

> **Definition.** Let $X, Y$ be objects in category $\mathcal{A}$. For $P \in \mathcal{A}$ and morphisms $\pi\_X : P \to X$, $\pi\_Y : P \to Y$, we call $P$ the **product** of $X, Y$ and write $P = X \times Y$ when the following condition is satisfied:

The above definition naturally generalises to products of three or more, or infinitely many objects. Readers familiar with the concept of limits will recognise that the product can be understood as the limit of a discrete category. Alternatively, the product can be understood as the _smallest_ category that fully encodes the information of the given objects.

In the category of sets, the product coincides with the Cartesian product. In particular, $\pi\_X, \pi\_Y$ are given by $(x, y) \mapsto x$ and $(x, y) \mapsto y$ respectively.

**In the category of topological spaces, the product is the product topology, not the box topology.** This is guaranteed by the following theorem:

> **Theorem.** The smallest topology on $\prod\_{i \in I}X\_i$ such that the projection functions $\pi\_k : \prod\_{i \in I}X\_i \to X\_k$ are continuous for each $k \in I$ is the product topology.

Whilst the box topology also has the property that each projection function is continuous, the box topology is a _larger_ topology than the product topology. Therefore, the box topology is not the categorical product.

Let us examine a counterexample showing that the box topology is not a product. Consider $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with the box topology. If the box topology were the categorical product, then for any continuous functions $f\_k: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there would exist a continuous function $i : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that $\pi\_k \circ i = f\_k$. If $f\_k: x \mapsto kx$, then $i$ would be $x \mapsto (x, 2x, 3x, \dots)$. In the box topology, $U = (0, 1)^\omega$ is an open set, so if $i$ were continuous, then $i^{-1}(U)$ would be an open set. However, $i^{-1}(U) = \lbrace 0 \rbrace $, so the box topology does not satisfy the property of a product.

## Direct Product and Direct Sum

The difference between the box topology and product topology lies in whether the entire space or only finitely many indices are non-trivial. A similar difference can be found in algebra.

> **Definition.** For a collection of vector spaces $\lbrace  V\_i \rbrace \_{i \in I}$, the **direct product** $\prod V\_i$ is defined as follows:
>
> $$
> \prod V_i = \left\{ (v_i)_{i \in I} : v_i \in V_i \right\}
> $$

> **Definition.** For a collection of vector spaces $\lbrace  V\_i \rbrace \_{i \in I}$, the **direct sum** $\bigoplus V\_i$ is defined as follows:
>
> $$
> \bigoplus V_i = \left\{ (v_i)_{i \in I} : v_i \in V_i,\; v_i \neq 0 \text{ for only finitely many }i \right\}
> $$

Vector operations are defined term-wise. The same definitions of direct product and direct sum can be applied to groups as well, not just vector spaces.

From the similarity between the definitions of direct product and box topology, and direct sum and product topology, one might think that the direct sum corresponds to the categorical product, but **this is not the case.** In algebra, **the direct product corresponds to the categorical product.** The direct sum does not generally satisfy the conditions of a categorical product.

Consider the following example: Let us examine the direct sum $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ of one-dimensional real spaces $\mathbb{R}$. If the direct sum were the categorical product, then for any linear maps $f\_k: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, there would exist a continuous function $i : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that $\pi\_k \circ i = f\_k$. If $f\_k: x \mapsto x$, then $i$ would be $x \mapsto (x, x, x, \dots)$. However, $i(1) = (1, 1, 1, \dots) \notin \mathbb{R}^\omega$, so the direct sum does not satisfy the property of a product.

Instead, the direct sum corresponds to the **categorical sum**. The categorical sum is also called a **coproduct** because it is the dual of the product.

> **Definition.** Let $X, Y$ be objects in category $\mathcal{A}$. For $S \in \mathcal{A}$ and morphisms $\sigma\_X : X \to S$, $\sigma\_Y : Y \to S$, we call $S$ the **sum** of $X, Y$ and write $S = X + Y$ when the following condition is satisfied:
>
> - For any $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and morphisms $f: X \to A$, $g: Y \to A$, there exists a unique morphism $i: S \to A$ such that the following diagram commutes:
>
> <img src="/public/categorical-sum.png" style="width: 320px; margin: 2em auto; mix-blend-mode: multiply;">

Let us revisit the earlier example. Consider the direct sum $\bigoplus\_\omega \mathbb{R}$. The morphism $\sigma\_k: \mathbb{R} \to \bigoplus\_\omega \mathbb{R}$ is given by:

$$
x \mapsto (0, \dots, 0, x, 0, \dots) \quad \text{($x$ is at the $k$th index)}
$$

Let $A = \mathbb{R}$ and consider the identity morphism $f\_k : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. If $\bigoplus\_\omega \mathbb{R}$ is the categorical sum, then there must exist a continuous function $i : \bigoplus\_\omega \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $i \circ \sigma\_k = f\_k$. Indeed, this exists as follows:

$$
i: (x_i)_{i \in \omega} \mapsto \sum_{i \in \omega} x_i
$$

Note that $i$ is well-defined because elements of $\bigoplus\_\omega \mathbb{R}$ have only finitely many non-trivial terms. Conversely, this example shows that the direct product $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is not the categorical sum. In the case of the direct product, $i$ is not well-defined. This can be seen by substituting $(1, 1, 1, \dots)$ into $i$.

For groups, the operations corresponding to categorical products and categorical sums differ slightly depending on whether we consider the general category of groups or the category of abelian groups. I shall leave this as a brief note.
