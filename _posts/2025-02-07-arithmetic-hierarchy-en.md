The **arithmetic hierarchy** is a classification of propositions in arithmetic — more precisely, first-order Peano arithmetic — according to the complexity of their quantifiers. The arithmetic hierarchy is a central concept in proof theory and computational complexity theory, and is also related to descriptive set theory.

## 1. $\Delta\_0$ Propositions

### 1.1. Definition

> **Definition.** $\Sigma\_0 = \Pi\_0 = \Delta\_0$ is the set of propositions containing only bounded quantifiers.

Why the same class of propositions is referred to by three names will become clear shortly. In this article, unless there is a specific reason otherwise, we shall use $\Delta\_0$ as the representative name among the three.

For example, the following four propositions are all $\Delta\_0$.

$$
\begin{gather}
\phi_1 : 0 = 1\\
\phi_2(x) : \exists y < x \; [y + y = x] \\
\phi_3(x, y) : \exists z \leq y \;[ xz = y ] \\
\end{gather}
$$

$\phi\_1$ is a false statement. $\phi\_2$ is true when $x$ is even, and $\phi\_3$ is true when $x$ is a divisor of $y$.

Since $\Delta\_0$ propositions have bounded quantifiers, it is possible to determine whether an arbitrary $x$ satisfies the corresponding proposition using a Turing machine. For instance, a Turing machine that determines whether $x$ satisfies $\phi\_2$ is as follows:

```
for y < x:
   if y + y == x:
      return true;

return false;
```

The above Turing machine halts within $x$ iterations. Therefore, $\Delta\_0$ propositions are **decidable**, **recursive**, or **computable** (the three expressions are synonymous). However, as we shall explain in detail later, not all decidable propositions are $\Delta\_0$.

According to Gödel's representability theorem, decidable true propositions are provable. In this article, when we say that $\phi$ is 'true', we mean $\mathcal{N} \vDash \phi$ for the standard model of arithmetics $\mathcal{N}$, rather than $\mathsf{PA} \vDash \phi$.

The following holds:

> **Theorem.** The set of true $\Delta\_0$ sentences is complete. (That is, if $\phi$ is a true $\Delta\_0$ sentence, then $\mathsf{PA} \vdash \phi$.)

### 1.2. $\Delta\_0$ in Computational Theory

From a programming language perspective, $\Delta\_0$ sentences correspond to the set of code that permits only the following:

- Conditional statements
- Bounded loops
- Addition and multiplication

It should be noted that _unbounded loops_ and _variable reassignment_ are not permitted. For example, the following code demonstrates that primality testing is $\Delta\_0$:

```
for y < x:
  for z <= y:
    if yz == x:
      return false;

return true;
```

However, the following code that computes $x^y$ does not correspond to $\Delta\_0$:

```
let a = 1
for 1<= z <= y:
   a = a * x

return a
```

So is exponentiation not $\Delta\_0$? Not necessarily. Although complex, there are [methods](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5032077/how-to-express-exponentiation-with-a-delta-0-formula) to express exponentiation with a $\Delta\_0$ proposition. This case demonstrates that determining whether a given operation or predicate is $\Delta\_0$ can be intricate. For instance, the following is known:

> **Theorem.** Factorial is $\Delta\_0$, but tetration is not $\Delta\_0$.

However, tetration is decidable. Therefore, not all decidable propositions are $\Delta\_0$.

### 2.1. $\Sigma\_1$ Propositions

The following propositions are $\Sigma\_1$:

$$
\begin{gather}
\phi_1(x): \exists y \; \underbrace{[y^2 + y + 1 = x]}_{\Pi_0}\\
\phi_2(x): ∃y\; ∃z\; \underbrace{(y \text{ is prime} ∧ z \text{ is prime} ∧ x = y + z ∧ x \text{ is even})}_{\Pi_0}
\end{gather}
$$

$\phi\_1$ is true in the set $\lbrace 1, 3, 7, 13, \ldots\rbrace $. $\phi\_2$ is Goldbach's conjecture; it is not known whether all $x$ satisfy this.

$\Sigma\_1$ is the collection of **recursively enumerable** sets. That is, if $\phi \in \Sigma\_1$, then there exists a Turing machine $M$ such that:

- If $\phi(c)$ is true, then $M$ is guaranteed to decide $\phi(c)$.
- If $\phi(c)$ is false, then $M$ is not guaranteed to decide $\phi(c)$.

For example, the following Turing machine shows that $\phi\_2$ is recursively enumerable:

```
for y > 1:
   for z > 1:
      if isPrime(y) & isPrime(z) & x = y + z & isEven(x):
         return true;

return false;
```

Although there is a `return false` statement, since there is no `break` statement to exit the loop, `return false` is unreachable. That is, if $\phi\_2(c)$ is true, the above Turing machine returns true, but if it is false, it falls into an infinite loop.

If $\phi \in \Sigma\_1$ is a sentence that is true in the standard model of arithmetics, then $\mathsf{PA} \vdash \phi$. A proposition of the form $\phi : \exists x \; \psi(x)$ being true in the standard model of arithmetics means that $\psi(c)$ is true for some $c \in \mathbb{N}$, and since $\psi(c)$ is a true $\Pi\_0$ sentence, it is provable. Therefore, the following holds:

> **Theorem.** The set of true $\Sigma\_1$ sentences is complete.

### 2.2. $\Sigma\_1 \setminus \Delta\_0$ Propositions

However, I have in fact been misleading the reader thus far. The propositions I listed earlier as examples of $\Sigma\_1$ can actually be written as $\Delta\_0$:

$$
\begin{gather}
\phi_1: \exists y<x \;{[y^2 + y + 1 = x]}\\
\phi_2(x): ∃y<x\; ∃z<x\; {(y \text{ is prime} ∧ z \text{ is prime} ∧ x = y + z ∧ x \text{ is even})}
\end{gather}
$$

So what do propositions that strictly belong to $\Sigma\_1$ look like? One answer can be found in the **halting problem**.

First, let $\mathrm{HaltsIn}(x, n)$ be a predicate that determines whether "the Turing machine with Gödel number $x$" produces an output within $n$ operations. This predicate can be easily defined from the **Kleene predicate**, and the Kleene predicate is known to be $\Sigma\_0$. For example, if the Gödel number of a Turing machine that computes the square of 3 in 2 operations is $123$, then $\mathrm{HaltsIn}(123, 3)$ is true but $\mathrm{HaltsIn}(123, 1)$ is false.

Now consider the following proposition:

$$
\phi_1(x): \exists y \;[ \mathrm{HaltsIn}(x, y) ]
$$

What this proposition states is that the Turing machine with Gödel number $x$ eventually halts. That is, the above proposition is equivalent to the halting problem. However, the halting problem is undecidable. Since we showed earlier that all $\Delta\_0$ propositions are decidable, $\phi$ is a $\Sigma\_1$ proposition that does not belong to $\Delta\_0$.

As another example, consider the following proposition:

$$
\phi_2(x): \exists y \; [ \mathrm{Proves}(x, y) ]
$$

Here, $\mathrm{Proves}(x, y)$ is a predicate that is true when the Gödel number of "a proof of the sentence with Gödel number $x$" is $y$. That is, $\phi\_2(x)$ is a predicate stating that the sentence with Gödel number $x$ is provable. However, this predicate is not decidable. If $\phi\_2$ were decidable, then (under the assumption that PA is consistent) there would exist a proof in PA that $\phi\_2(\ulcorner 0 = 1 \urcorner)$ is false, which would conflict with Gödel's incompleteness theorem.

### 2.3. $\Pi\_1$ Propositions

If $\Sigma\_1$ propositions are the collection of recursively enumerable propositions, then $\Pi\_1$ propositions are the collection of **co-recursively enumerable** propositions. That is, a $\Pi\_1$ sentence is decidable if false, but not necessarily decidable if true. For example, the following two propositions are $\Pi\_1$ sentences that are not $\Delta\_0$:

$$
\begin{gather}
\phi_3(x): \forall y \;[ \lnot \mathrm{HaltsIn}(x, y) ] \\
\phi_4(x): \forall y \; [ \lnot \mathrm{Proves}(x, y) ]
\end{gather}
$$

Unlike the case of $\Sigma\_1$, $\Pi\_1$ is not complete. Since the negation of a $\Sigma\_1$ sentence is $\Pi\_1$, if $\Pi\_1$ were also complete, then $\Sigma\_1 = \Pi\_1 =$ (collection of decidable propositions).

> **Theorem.** The set of true $\Pi\_1$ sentences is not complete.

### 2.4. $\Delta\_1$ Propositions

$\Delta\_1$ propositions belong to both $\Sigma\_1$ and $\Pi\_1$. Therefore, $\Delta\_1$ is the collection of **decidable** propositions. The tetration we saw earlier is a $\Delta\_1$ proposition that is not $\Delta\_0$.

## 3. Moving Up Another Level

> **Definition.**
>
> $$
> \begin{gather}
> \Sigma_2 := \{ \exists x_1 \cdots \exists x_n \;\phi : \phi \in \Pi_1 \}\\
> \Pi_2 := \{ \forall x_1 \cdots \forall x_n \;\phi : \phi \in \Sigma_1 \}\\
> \Delta_2 := \Sigma_2 \cap \Pi_2
> \end{gather}
> $$

I believe the pattern should now be clear. As an example of a $\Sigma\_2$ proposition, consider the following:

$$
\phi_5(x) : \exists y \; [ \mathrm{DoesNotHaltOn}(x, y)]
$$

Here, $\mathrm{DoesNotHaltOn}(x, y)$ is a predicate that is true if "the Turing machine with Gödel number $x$" does not halt when given input $y$. From the preceding discussion, it is not difficult to see that $\mathrm{DoesNotHaltOn}$ is $\Pi\_1$.

> **Theorem.** $\phi\_5 \notin \Pi\_1$

**Proof.** Suppose $\phi\_5 \in \Pi\_1$. Our goal is to show that this assumption implies "the set of true $\Pi\_1$ sentences is complete".

Let $\psi(x)$ be an arbitrary $\Delta\_0$ proposition. Then $\theta : \forall x \;\psi(x)$ is a $\Pi\_1$ sentence. Consider the following Turing machine $M$:

```
if ψ(x):
   return 1;

while True:
```

This Turing machine halts for value $x$ if $\psi(x)$ is true and does not halt if it is false. Therefore, $\theta$ being true is equivalent to $M$ halting for all $x$, which is equivalent to $\phi\_5(\ulcorner M \urcorner)$ being false. By assumption, $\phi\_5 \in \Pi\_1$, so if $\phi\_5(\ulcorner M \urcorner)$ is false, then $\mathsf{PA} \vdash \lnot \phi(\ulcorner M \urcorner)$. That is, $\mathsf{PA} \vdash \theta$, making all true $\Pi\_1$ sentences provable. This is a contradiction. ■

_Remark._ Strictly speaking, one should show that the above proof is expressible within PA.

We said earlier that $\Sigma\_1$ propositions are decidable when true, and $\Pi\_1$ propositions are decidable when false. However, since $\Sigma\_2$ sentences have mixed $\forall$ and $\exists$ quantifiers, there may be sentences that are undecidable both when true and when false.

### 3.1. Oracles

> **Definition.** When $\mathcal{O}$ can obtain the result of problem $P$ in a single operation, we call $\mathcal{O}$ an **oracle** for $P$.

For example, an oracle for the halting problem is a truly divine entity that can determine whether a given Turing machine halts in a single operation.

Ascending the arithmetic hierarchy is equivalent to being given increasingly powerful oracles. We saw earlier the following as an example of a $\Sigma\_1$ proposition:

$$
\phi_1(x): \exists y \;[ \mathrm{HaltsIn}(x, y) ]
$$

However, if a halting problem oracle $\mathcal{O}$ were given, $\phi\_1$ could be expressed simply as a $\Delta\_0$ proposition:

$$
\phi_1(x) : \mathcal{O}(x)
$$

Also, we saw earlier the following as an example of a $\Sigma\_2$ proposition:

$$
\phi_5(x) : \exists y \; [ \mathrm{DoesNotHaltOn}(x, y)]
$$

If a halting problem oracle $\mathcal{O}$ were given, $\phi\_5$ could be expressed as a $\Sigma\_1$ proposition:

$$
\phi_5(x): \exists y \; \lnot \mathcal{O}(x|_y)
$$

Here, $x\|\_y$ is the Gödel number of the state where input $y$ is given to the Turing machine with Gödel number $x$. That is, $\Sigma\_2$ propositions reduce to $\Sigma\_1$ propositions when given an oracle for the halting problem. By similar principles, $\Pi\_2$ and $\Delta\_2$ propositions reduce to $\Pi\_1$ and $\Delta\_1$ propositions, respectively, when given an oracle for the halting problem.

Furthermore, we can define **second-order oracles**. A second-order halting problem oracle is a halting problem oracle for Turing machines that use halting problem oracles. For example, whilst $\mathcal{O}$ is limited to determining whether the following code halts:

```
for x > 0:
   for y > 0:
      for z > 0:
         for n > 2:
            if x^n + y^n == z^n:
               return True;
return False;
```

$\mathcal{O}^2$ can also determine whether the following code halts. The following code takes as input the Gödel number $x$ of an NP Turing machine, halts if there exists a P Turing machine whose output matches $x$, and does not halt if no such machine exists:

```
let x ∈ NP;
for y ∈ P:
   if !Halts(
      let z = 0
      while x(z) == y(z):
         z = z + 1
   ):
      return 1; // halts when x is an NP that belongs to P
```

In general, the following holds:

> **Theorem.** Propositions in $\Pi\_n$, $\Sigma\_n$, $\Delta\_n$ become propositions in $\Pi\_{n-k}$, $\Sigma\_{n-k}$, $\Delta\_{n-k}$, respectively, when given a $k$-th order oracle.
