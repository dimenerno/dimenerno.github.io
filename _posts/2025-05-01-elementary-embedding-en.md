For convenience, this article takes the approach of reducing function expressions $f(a) = c$ to binary predicates $F(a, c)$, rather than treating predicates and functions as separate objects.

An injective homomorphism is not necessarily an embedding. For example, consider the following two structures of language $\mathcal{L}$ with one binary relation $<$. Objects satisfying $<$ are indicated by arrows. That is, $b\_1 <^\mathfrak{B} b\_2$.

Since no elements in $\mathfrak{A}$ satisfy $<^\mathfrak{A}$, the mapping $f: a\_1 \mapsto b\_1, a\_2 \mapsto b\_2$ is trivially a homomorphism and is injective. However, $f$ is not an embedding. If $f$ were an embedding, then from $b\_1 <^\mathfrak{B} b\_2$ it would follow that $a\_1 <^\mathfrak{A} a\_2$. That is, an embedding must preserve not only the elements of $\mathfrak{A}$ but also the relationships between elements in $\mathfrak{B}$. In this respect, embeddings are similar to full functors in category theory.

> **Definition.** Let $\mathfrak{A}$ be a structure of language $\mathcal{L}$. Define $\mathcal{L}\_\mathfrak{A}$ as the language obtained by adding to $\mathcal{L}$ as many constants as the size of the domain of $\mathfrak{A}$.

For example with Peano arithmetic, when $\mathcal{L} = (0, S, +)$ and $\mathfrak{A}$ is the standard model of arithmetic, then $\mathcal{L}\_\mathfrak{A} = (0, 1, 2, 3, \dots, S, +)$.

The notation $\Delta$ is related to the [arithmetic hierarchy](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/02/07/arithmetic-hierarchy/).

Since $\Delta\_\mathfrak{A}$ is obtained by adding the negations of atomic propositions missing from $\Delta\_\mathfrak{A}^+$, the two sets contain essentially the same information. Nevertheless, we define the two sets separately because of the following theorem.

> **Theorem.** Let $\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B}$ be $\mathcal{L}$-structures.
>
> 1. There exists an injective homomorphism $f: \mathfrak{A} \to \mathfrak{B}$ if and only if $\mathfrak{B}$ is an $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-model of $\Delta_\mathfrak{A}^+$.
> 2. There exists an embedding $f: \mathfrak{A} \to \mathfrak{B}$ if and only if $\mathfrak{B}$ is an $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-model of $\Delta_\mathfrak{A}$.

That is, when $\mathfrak{B}$ satisfies $\Delta_\mathfrak{A}^+$, there is a possibility that $\mathfrak{B}$ satisfies atomic propositions 'excessively', preventing $\mathfrak{A}$ from being embedded into $\mathfrak{B}$. However, when $\mathfrak{B}$ satisfies $\Delta_\mathfrak{A}$, there are constraints on which atomic propositions $\mathfrak{B}$ can satisfy, thus guaranteeing the possibility of embedding.

In a [previous article](https://dimenerno.github.io/2025/04/17/los-tarski/), we introduced the concept of **elementary submodel**. From this, we can define the following concept.

> **Definition.** When $f: \mathfrak{A} \to \mathfrak{B}$ is an embedding and $f[\mathfrak{A}]$ is an elementary submodel of $\mathfrak{B}$, we call $f$ an **elementary embedding**.

The set of sentences related to elementary embeddings is as follows.

> **Definition.** Let $E(\mathfrak{A})$ denote the set of all $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-propositions satisfied by $\mathfrak{A}$. That is,
>
> $$
> E(\mathfrak{A}) = \{ \phi : \mathfrak{A} \vDash \phi \}
> $$

The most distinguishing feature of $E(\mathfrak{A})$ from $\Delta_\mathfrak{A}$ is that it also includes sentences with quantifiers.

> **Theorem.** Let $\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B}$ be $\mathcal{L}$-structures. There exists an elementary embedding $f: \mathfrak{A} \to \mathfrak{B}$ if and only if $\mathfrak{B}$ is an $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-model of $E(\mathfrak{A})$.

Finally, the following set of sentences is worth mentioning.

> **Definition.** Let $\mathfrak{A}$ be an $\mathcal{L}$-structure. Let $\mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A})$ denote the set of all $\mathcal{L}$-sentences true in $\mathfrak{A}$.

> **Theorem.** Let $\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B}$ be $\mathcal{L}$-structures. $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are elementarily equivalent if and only if $\mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A}) = \mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{B})$.

In fact, this is nothing more than the definition of elementary equivalence, so it hardly deserves to be called a theorem, but it has been included here to maintain consistency with the other theorems introduced in this article.

Summarising in a table:

|                             | Definition                                                     | Example                       | Mapping                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| $\Delta_\mathfrak{A}^+$     | $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-atomic propositions satisfied by $\mathfrak{A}$ | $0 < 1$                       | Surjective homomorphism      |
| $\Delta_\mathfrak{A}$       | $\Delta_0$ $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-propositions satisfied by $\mathfrak{A}$ | $\lnot(1 < 0)$                | Embedding (submodel)         |
| $\mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{A})$ | $\mathcal{L}$-propositions satisfied by $\mathfrak{A}$        | $\forall x \exists y (x < y)$ | Elementary equivalence       |
| $E(\mathfrak{A})$           | $\mathcal{L}_\mathfrak{A}$-propositions satisfied by $\mathfrak{A}$ | $\not \exists x (x < 0)$      | Elementary embedding (elementary submodel) |

For example, $\mathfrak{A} = (\mathbb{N}, <)$ embeds into $\mathfrak{B} = (\mathbb{Z}, <)$, but does not embed elementarily. This is because $\mathfrak{B}$ does not satisfy the sentence $\not \exists x (x < 0)$ from $E(\mathfrak{A})$.
