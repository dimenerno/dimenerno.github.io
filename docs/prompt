Translate the following blog post into British English, in an academic style. If the post is tagged with "Mathematics", translate in mathematical writing style. That is, translate technical terms (such as "정칙 공간", "정규 공간") into their corresponding English terms ("regular space", "normal space"). If the post is tagged with "Philosophy", translate in philosophical writing style. That is, translate technical terms (such as "이성", "경험적") to their corresponding English terms ("rationality", "empirical"). Try to make the translation flow naturally and stylistically simple. Abstain from having too much of a "machine-translated" vibe. Capitalise the letters of tags in front matter, but do not capitalise prepositions and articles such as "of" and "and". Add `lang: en` to the front matter. DO NOT TOUCH ANY LATEX EQUATIONS, i.e. KEEP CONTENT INSIDE $...$ or $$...$$ UNTOUCHED AT ALL CASES. For phrases with the form "A<sub>B</sub>" where B is the English translation of A, simply remove the sub tag and translate A to B. But if B is not English (for example, German) then translate A into English and keep the sub tag. Keep markdown and html syntax intact. Add the following blockquote in beginning of the article: "This post was machine translated and has not yet been proofread. It may contain minor errors or unnatural expressions. Proofreading will be done in the near future."
